## Credits
* Thanks to Truf for creating and providing his Verbatim macros, upon which many of these macros and sub procedures are built upon! Macros in the Debate Utility Booster Suite that are built upon macros or code that Truf wrote have more specific attribution in their header(s). You can find Truf's macros in [this post](https://debate-decoded.ghost.io/leveling-up-verbatim/) on [his website](https://debate-decoded.ghost.io/).
